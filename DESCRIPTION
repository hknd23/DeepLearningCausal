Description: Functions to estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) 
    and Population Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (PATT) from 
    experimental or observational data using the Super Learner (SL) ensemble 
    method and Deep neural networks. The package first provides functions to 
    implement meta-learners such as the Single-learner (S-learner) and 
    Two-learner (T-learner) described in KÃ¼nzel et al. (2019) 
    <doi:10.1073/pnas.1804597116> for estimating the CATE. The S- and T-learner 
    are each estimated using the SL ensemble method and deep neural networks. It 
    then provides functions to implement the Ottoboni and Poulos (2020) 
    <doi:10.1515/jci-2018-0035>  PATT-C estimator to obtain the PATT from 
    experimental data with noncompliance by using the SL ensemble method and 
    deep neural networks.
