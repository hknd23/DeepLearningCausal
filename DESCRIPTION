Description: DNetCausalPATT is an R package that provides functions to estimate
    Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) and Population Average Treatment
    Effects on the Treated (PATT) from experimental or observational data using 
    the Super Learner (SL) ensemble method and Deep neural networks. The package 
    first provides functions to implement meta-learners such as the Single-learner 
    (S-learner) and Two-learner (T-learner) described in KÃ¼nzel et al. (2019) for 
    estimating the CATE. The S- and T-learner are each estimated using the SL 
    ensemble method and deep neural networks. It then provides functions to 
    implement the Ottoboni and Poulos (2020) PATT-C estimator to obtain the PATT 
    from experimental data with noncompliance by using the SL ensemble method 
    and deep neural networks.
