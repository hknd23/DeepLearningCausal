\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing sampled individual treatment effects
with their weighted conformal prediction intervals.

\description{
Visualizes the distribution of estimated individual treatment effects (ITEs)
along with their corresponding conformal prediction intervals.
The function randomly samples a proportion of observations from a fitted
\code{metalearner_ensemble} or \code{metalearner_deeplearning} object and
plots the conformal intervals as vertical ranges around the point estimates.
This allows users to visually assess the uncertainty and variation in
estimated treatment effects.
}
\details{
The function extracts the estimated ITEs (\code{CATEs}) and conformal intervals
(\code{ITE_lower}, \code{ITE_upper}) from the model output, samples a subset
of rows, and generates a \code{ggplot2} visualization.
Each vertical line represents the conformal prediction interval for one observationâ€™s
treatment effect estimate.
The conformal intervals are typically obtained from weighted split-conformal inference,
using propensity overlap weights to adjust interval width.
